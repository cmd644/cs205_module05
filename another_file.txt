2077. My time, my city, my family. When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. They had other plans. The time travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on, was me.
